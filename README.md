# Task
We have created **CarbonLens**, a tool that helps ML teams and companies assess the environmental impacts of training AI Models. The tool provides a dashboard that allows users to input the details of their model and get an estimate of the carbon emissions associated with training the model.

# Running the Application
To run the application, you can follow the steps below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the required packages, you can run the application using the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

And your app should be running ðŸ˜Š
